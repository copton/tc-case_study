- on call of blocking functions, parameters which go to the state struct anyway
  are directly stored there by the caller instead of passing them as normal
  parameters.

- first writing the PAL then generate the code.

PAL
====
- PAL must be generated because it depends on the number of threads
- no guarantee that callee returns before continuation is called!
- meta-information, which parameter remains in the parameter list.
- PAL can become inefficient, but this depends on the OS' API, not on the general concept of code generation

optimization
============
 - sometimes caller can operate directly on the state struct of the callee instead of instantiating it's own copies of the variable.
 - thread-id mapping can omitted if there is only one caller
 - storing the continuation can be omitted if there is only one caller
 - lookup for
